# War Room Aid Kit

Diagnosing Web3 errors is complex and hard, that’s why development teams have adopted War Rooms in response to high-stakes errors and hacks. With Tenderly you can now adopt a War Room procedure and be ready when the problem arises.

**Detect issues faster**

If the number of contracts in the transaction is greater than 30 then **Call Trace** will be automatically triggered. You can switch it yourself if you’re only interested in seeing external calls that are usually crucial for the attack. Use **Expression Evaluation** to better understand the whole context of the transaction and simplify the debugging process.

\
**Collaborate and prioritize**

With the new annotation system, you can leave comments on the exact line of code you think caused the issue. Annotations can be used to make team collaboration more efficient or to leave a note for yourself so you don’t forget it later. You can also set a priority for traces you want to be inspected first.
