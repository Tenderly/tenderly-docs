The extension itself is pretty straightforward - when installed, the link to open and view a transaction in Tenderly will pop up next to a transaction hash on any of the block explorers. You can download it on the following link ðŸ‘‡

This Chrome (and Brave) extension allows you to open/view transactions from any block explorer in Tenderly Debugger with just one click - so you can instantly inspect, decode and debug transactions in-depth with features such as:

\- [Execution Trace](https://docs.tenderly.co/debugger/how-to-use-tenderly-debugger#execution-trace) (Call and Function Traces), with [commenting and prioritization of traces](https://docs.tenderly.co/monitoring/contracts/commenting-and-prioritizing-traces) for easier collaboration.

\- Detailed [Gas Profiler](https://docs.tenderly.co/monitoring/contracts/execution-overview#gas-profiler) with a granular breakdown of gas spending down to a single call.

\- [Advanced Search](https://docs.tenderly.co/monitoring/contracts#advanced-trace-search) with filtering across types (Op Code, Function, Variableâ€¦).

\- Ability to easily [(Re)Simulate any transaction](https://docs.tenderly.co/simulations-and-forks/how-to-simulate-a-transaction) (or transaction batches) by [changing any or all of the parameters/states](https://docs.tenderly.co/simulations-and-forks/how-to-simulate-a-transaction/transaction-parameters).

\- See the transaction outcome even before it is processed on-chain with [complete Mempool access](https://docs.tenderly.co/monitoring/contracts/mempool-and-simulating-pending-transactions).

Jump into any transaction on [20+ supported networks](../supported-networks-and-languages.md) and see how they execute, what are the outputs and follow everything that happens on EVM-based blockchains.&#x20;

**See how you can optimize gas costs for individual transactions or transaction batches. Debug errors with pinpoint precision, test potential hack/bug fixes and code optimizations.**

We donâ€™t really like to toot our own horn in this way, but the level of detail present in Tenderly Debugger doesnâ€™t exist anywhere else and reduces development time by orders of magnitude (for real). Enjoy :)
