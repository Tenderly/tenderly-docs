# Alert Types, Targets, and Parameters

To create and enable an Alert, you need to specify and configure the following components:

* **Alert Type:** On-chain event that triggers Tenderly to send you a notification. There are 12 alert triggers to choose from.
* **Alert Target:** Address or addresses you want to monitor. The Target options are the same across all Alert Types and include:
  * **Address:** Monitor a single address.
  * **Network:** Monitor all addresses deployed on a network of your choice.
  * **Project:** Monitor all addresses that are part of a project on Tenderly.
  * **Tag:** Monitor all contracts and wallets labeled with the specific tag.
* **Alert Parameters:** Additional settings specific to the selected Alert Type.
* **Alert Destination:** The place where you want to receive notifications. One Alert can send notifications to multiple destinations. There are 8 destinations where you can send and receive notifications.

The rest of this document focuses on different Alert Types.

5. **Set the balance threshold value in Wei.** This alert is triggered only when a transaction sets the balance of an address to a value that satisfies set conditions. It is not triggered when the balance is in the state of satisfied conditions.
6. [**Set the Destination**](configuring-alert-destinations/) by creating a new one or select one you previously created.
7. **Click Save** to get notified when the network's native currency balance on your smart contract or wallet matches the threshold conditions you defined.

## Transaction Value

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/tx_value_params.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Parameters for the Transaction Value Alert</p></figcaption></figure>

The Transaction Value alert notifies you when the value of a transaction involving a wallet or smart contract matches some value in Wei.

To create a Transaction Value alert, complete the following steps:

1. **Select Transaction Value** from the list of Alert Types.
2. From the Target section, **select Address** to monitor a smart contract or wallet deployed on a specific address.
3. **Select the comparator operator** (e.g., equal to, greater than, etc.).
4. **Enter the value in Wei** that you want to compare against.
5. [**Set the Destination**](configuring-alert-destinations/) by creating a new one or select one you previously created.
6. **Click Save** to get notified when the value of a transaction coming from the wallet or smart contract matches the value in Wei you specified.

## State Change

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/state_change_3_params.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Parameters for the State Change Alert</p></figcaption></figure>

The State Change alert notifies you when a numeric (int/uint) state variable in a smart contract is changed. With this alert, you can get notifications when the number of required confirmations in a multisig increases or decreases. Similarly, you can observe any other configuration-like state variable of a smart contract.

To create a State Change alert, complete the following steps:

1. **Select State Change** from the list of Alert Types.
2. From the Target section, **select Address** to monitor a smart contract or wallet deployed on a specific address.
3. **Select the state variable** from the smart contract that you want to monitor.
4. **Configure additional parameters** for the selected state variable. Depending on the data type of the state variable, you need to configure additional parameters to tell Tenderly how to compare the property value of the state variable to what you want:
   * **Threshold passed:** Triggers when the property value passes a threshold. Youâ€™ll get only one alert each time the value passes the threshold.
   * **Percentage change:** Triggers when the property value increases or decreases by a percentage you set.
   * **Criteria:** Triggers when the new property value set by a transaction matches the comparison criteria.
   * **Value changed:** Triggers the alert whenever the property value changes.
5. [**Set the Destination**](configuring-alert-destinations/) by creating a new one or select one you previously created.
6. **Click Save** to get notified when the state variable in the smart contract changes.

## View Function

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/view_function_params.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Parameters for the View Function Alert</p></figcaption></figure>

The View Function alert notifies you when the return value of a selected `view` function in a smart contract is changed by a transaction. For example, you can track when the balance of a particular address of an ERC-20 token changes by using the `balanceOf('0x...')` view function.

To create a View Function alert, complete the following steps:

1. **Select View Function** from the list of Alert Types.
2. From the Target section, **select Address** to monitor a smart contract or wallet deployed on a specific address.
3. **Choose the smart contract address.**
4. From the list of declared view functions, **select the view function** that you want to monitor. You will have to specify any arguments view function may require.
5. **Configure additional parameters** depending on the data type returned by the view function.
   1. **Threshold passed:** Define the threshold and get alerted when the return value passes the threshold value. You also need to define the comparator type (less than, equal to, etc.) and the value with which to make the comparison. Youâ€™ll get only one alert each time the value passes the threshold.
   2. **Percentage change:** Define the percentage and get alerted when the changes by a certain percentage. You also need to define the comparator type and the value with which to make the comparison.
   3. **Criteria:** Define any type of criteria that you want using the different comparator operators and get notified when the criteria are met.
   4. **Value changed:** Get notified whenever the return value changes in any way.
6. [**Set the Destination**](configuring-alert-destinations/) by creating a new one or select one you previously created.
7. **Click Save** to get notified when the return value of a view function you selected changes compared to the previous block.
