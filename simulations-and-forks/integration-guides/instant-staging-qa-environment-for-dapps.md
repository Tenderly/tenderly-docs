# Instant Staging/QA Environment for Dapps

## Overview&#x20;

Welcome to the detailed guide on creating an instant staging environment for your dapp. We will lead you through the process of creating a staging environment that uses real-time blockchain data in this guide. You will be able to conduct numerous tests on your smart contract code by following these procedures, ensuring its stability and dependability.&#x20;

When creating a dapp, it is critical to properly test both the frontend integration and the backend services. While an isolated environment is beneficial for bug prevention, it may not accurately represent the complexities of a real-world project. By employing real-time blockchain data, an instant staging environment delivers a more realistic testing environment.

Now, let's dive into the step-by-step process of creating an instant staging environment for your dapp:

## FE-only staging environment

To create a staging environment for frontend testing, you need to complete the following steps:&#x20;

1. Create a Tenderly Fork via the UI.
2. Connect ethers with a Tenderly Fork provider.
3. Populate transaction parameters and execute a transaction simulation.

### Step 1: Create a Tenderly Fork via the UI

To create a Tenderly Fork from the Dashboard, you can follow this guide:&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../forks/using-forks-ui.md" %}
[using-forks-ui.md](../forks/using-forks-ui.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Once the Fork has been created, you can copy the RPC URL directly from your Dashboard. It should look something like this:&#x20;

`https://rpc.tenderly.co/fork/21981657-3edf-4996-9776-918724c59e78`

### Step 2: Connect ethers with a Tenderly Fork provider

We recommend that you keep your Fork RPC URL hidden from the public. Here, in this code example, we'll extract it from the environment variables:

```tsx
const {	TENDERLY_JSON_RPC_URL } = process.env

const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(TENDERLY_JSON_RPC_URL);
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, provider)
```

### Step 3: Populate transaction parameters and execute a transaction simulation

Now that we have our provider and our contract instance, letâ€™s run a transaction simulation on a Tenderly Fork signed by the user's wallet address. Keep in mind that every account is automatically unlocked when performing simulations.&#x20;

This enables you to impersonate any address and send transactions, even as smart contracts:

```tsx
const unsignedTx = await contract.populateTransaction[funcName](...args)
const transactionParameters = [{
    to: contract.address,
    from: sender,
    data: unsignedTx.data,
    gas: ethers.utils.hexValue(300000),
    gasPrice: ethers.utils.hexValue(1),
    value: ethers.utils.hexValue(0)
}];

const txHash = await provider.send('eth_sendTransaction', transactionParameters)
```

Thatâ€™s it, you're all set ðŸŽ‰

Make sure to propagate the `provider` in every `ethers.js` contract instance and use it in all interactions.

## BE + FE staging environment

Alternatively, you can have your backend service create a Fork and propagate the RPC URL of the Tenderly Fork to your frontend.

Here are the needed steps:

1. Generate an API access key.
2. Create a Tenderly Fork via a backend service.
3. Report RPC URL of Tenderly Fork to the FE.
4. Connect ethers.js in FE.

### Step 1: Obtain the Tenderly API access key

You need the access key to interact with Tenderly API. If you donâ€™t have it already, hereâ€™s how you can get it:

{% content-ref url="../reference/configuration-of-api-access.md" %}
[configuration-of-api-access.md](../reference/configuration-of-api-access.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

#### Step 2: Create a Tenderly Fork via a backend service

We're going to create our Tenderly Fork environment via API rather than the Tenderly UI.

Letâ€™s do it for the Ethereum **Mainnet** on the **14386016** block number.

```tsx
const { TENDERLY_USER, TENDERLY_PROJECT, TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY } = process.env;
const TENDERLY_FORK_API = `http://api.tenderly.co/api/v1/account/${TENDERLY_USER}/project/${TENDERLY_PROJECT}/fork`;

const opts = {
    headers: {,
        'X-Access-Key': TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY,
  }
}

const body = {
    "network_id": "1",
    "block_number": 14386016,
}

const resp = await axios.post(TENDERLY_FORK_API, body, opts);

const forkId = resp.data.simulation_fork.id
const forkRPC = `https://rpc.tenderly.co/fork/${forkId}`
```

### Step 3: Forward the Fork RPC URL to the FE

After creating a Fork via a backend service, letâ€™s forward the Fork URL to the FE but feel free to use it in the BE as well.

Here are some ideas that can help you get started:&#x20;

* Expose an HTTP route for creating a Fork environment. The FE can invoke it and then consume the RPC endpoint directly.
* Have a proxy service that would route every JSON-RPC request from FE through your backend service to the Tenderly JSON-RPC.

### Step 4: Connect ethers.js in the dApp

Letâ€™s remind ourselves just how easy it is to set up ethers.js

```tsx
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(forkRPC);
```

## Recap

What did we just do? Well, you just created a staging evironment for your dapp based on real-time blockchain data with Tenderly ðŸŽ‰

By following the steps demonstrated in this comprehensive guide, you have unlocked a valuable tool that will considerably improve your dapp development process. Remember that your staging environment is more than just a testing ground. It is an essential part of your dapp development workflow, allowing you to confidently iterate, debug, and refine your code. Tenderly gives you access to a complete set of features and tools that will help you optimize your testing process and develop a high-quality dapp that fulfills the needs of your users.
